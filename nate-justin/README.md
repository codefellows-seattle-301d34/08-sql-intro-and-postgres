# Project Name

**Author**: Nate Aurich and Justin Whitaker
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This is an application for creating, updating, and browsing blog articles.

## Getting Started
Fork the repo; clone it locally; install Node, Node Package Manager, Nodemon, Express server, PostgreSQL, pg, the code editor of your choice, and of course Git if it's not already installed.

## Architecture
This application uses Express server to interface with a JavaScript server configuration file that in turn interfaces with a PostGreSQL database. 

## Change Log
17 May 2018 - added server and database functionality


## Credits and Collaborations
Shoutouts to Mario Nishio, Cameron Moorehead, and Michelle Ferreire for guiding us back to the right $PATH when we went astray and explaining what was needed and how things work in the app.
