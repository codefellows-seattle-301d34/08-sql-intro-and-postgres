# Project Name - SQL Intro & Postgres

 ** Author ** - Roman Kireev and Sam Porter Giffords
 ** Version**: 1.0.1
 
 ## Overview
 This blog application allows posting from a array of objects containing similar attributes, but with different information.  These objects are now stored in a database, rather than being passed in from a data file.
 
 ## Getting Started
 Go to GitHub, fork the repo down and clone it into their terminal for their editor to use.  Start the server (Node.js) using nodemon and start the database (SQL) using psql.
 
 ## Architecture
 This application makes use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the jQuery library, Handlebars, PostgreSQL, and Node.js.  
 
 ## Change Log
 This application is still a work in progress.
